    <h2>Lyrics: [Intro]</h2>
    <pre>
        Am Bm C D Em
    </pre>
    
    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <pre>
        Em        D            C
        I was down, my dreams were wearing thin
                Am    D              Bm
        When you're lost, where do you begin?
        C     D                 Bm               Em
        My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
         C                        D
        Looking for the love that never came my way

                 Em         D         C
        Then you smiled and I reached out to you
                Am   D               Bm
        I could tell you were lonely too
            C        D            Bm               Em
        One look and then it all began for you and me
            C                        D
        The moment that we touched I knew that there would be
    </pre>

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <pre>
        G
        Two less lonely people in the world
        Bm
        And it's gonna be fine
        C
        Out of all the people in the world
        Cm                          D
        I just can't believe you're mine
        G
        In my life where everything was wrong
        Bm                     Em
        Something finally went right
                Am
        Now there's two less lonely people
               D
        In the world tonight
    </pre>

    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    <pre>
        Em    D    C
        Just to think what I might have missed
            Am    D         Bm
        Looking back how did I exist
          C              D       Bm                    Em
        I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
            C                     D
        But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

        And all the things I never knew
        Am                Bm
        Seemed to come to me somehow
                C             D
