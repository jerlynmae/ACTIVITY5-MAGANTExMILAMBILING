        [Intro]
        G  C  G  C

        [Verse 1]
        G                 C
        Nobody knows
        G                 C
        Just why we're here
        G               C
        Could it be fate
        G               C
        Or random circumstance
        G               C
        At the right place
        G                 C
        At the right time
        G           C
        Two roads intertwine
        G              C
        And if the universe conspired
        G             C
        To meld our lives
        G                    C
        To make us

        [Chorus]
        G               C
        Fuel and fire
        Em              D
        Then know
        C                   G
        Where ever you will be
        Em              D
        So too shall I be
        C                      G
        Close your eyes
        Em            D
        Dry your tears
        C                  G
        'Cause when nothing seems clear
        Em             D
        You'll be safe here
        C  G  C

        [Verse 2]
        G               C
        In the unknown
        G                  C
        The shadows lurking
        G                   C
        Fear the unknown
        G               C
        But rest assured
        G              C
        I'll be there
        G                  C
        To hold you
        G                 C
        And if living
        G                C
        Is all we have
        G               C
        Then let's live it
        G                 C
        Live it out loud
        G                 C
        Here in the silence
        G                C
        Within the noise

        [Chorus]
        G               C
        Anywhere you are
        Em              D
        Where ever you go
        C                    G
        Every smile, every laugh
        Em                 D
        And tear that falls
        C                  G
        You'll be safe here
        Em                D
        Where ever you are
        C                    G
        I never will be far away
        Em                D
        Hear me when I say

        [Bridge]
        C                      G
        You'll be safe here
        Em            D
        And I will be here
        C            G
        Where nothing
        Em            D
        Can harm you
        C                     G
        I am close enough
        Em                   D
        To fight away
        C                 G
        Your every fear
        Em                 D
        Anywhere you are
        C                     G
        Where nothing can harm you
        Em                 D
        No matter how far
        C                  G
        You'll be safe here
        Em                D
        From the start

        [Chorus]
        C              G
        Till the end
        Em               D
        Don't you worry
        C                  G
        You'll be safe here
        Em                D
        You'll be safe here
        C                  G
        You'll be safe here
        Em                D
        You'll be safe here
        C  G  C
