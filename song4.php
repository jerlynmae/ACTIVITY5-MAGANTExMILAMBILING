        [Verse]
        G                   D        Em
        Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years
        C              G               D
        There was only you and me, we were young and wild and free
        G                   D        Em
        Now, nothin' can take you away from me
        C              G               D
        We've been down that road before, but that's over now
        C                      D
        You keep me comin' back for more

        [Chorus]
        G         Em     C        D
        Baby, you're all that I want
        G          Em    C        D
        When you're lyin' here in my arms
        G         Em        C        D
        I'm findin' it hard to believe
        C                D                G   D  Em  C
        We're in heaven, oh, oh, oh, heaven, whoa, oh

        [Verse]
        G                   D        Em
        Now, nothin' can change what you mean to me
        C              G             D
        There's a lot that I could say, but just hold me now
        C                      D
        'Cause our love will light the way

        [Chorus]
        G         Em     C        D
        Baby, you're all that I want
        G          Em    C        D
        When you're lyin' here in my arms
        G         Em        C        D
        I'm findin' it hard to believe
        C                D                G   D  Em  C
        We're in heaven, oh, oh, oh, heaven, whoa, oh

        [Bridge]
        Em                      C
        I've been waitin' for so long
        Em                       C
        For somethin' to arrive, for love to come along
        Em                      C
        Now, our dreams are comin' true
        Em                            C
        Through the good times and the bad, I'll be standin' there by you

        [Chorus]
        G         Em     C        D
        Baby, you're all that I want
        G          Em    C        D
        When you're lyin' here in my arms
        G         Em        C        D
        I'm findin' it hard to believe
        C                D                G   D  Em  C
        We're in heaven

        [Outro]
        G          Em        C        D
        And love is all that I need
        G          Em        C        D
        And I found it there in your heart
        G          Em        C        D
        It isn't too hard to see
        C                D                G   D  Em  C
        We're in heaven, oh, oh, oh, heaven
