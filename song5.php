    <pre>
        [Verse]
        G               D         Em
        Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
        C              G             D
        And everything you do, yeah, they were all yellow
        G            D         Em
        I came along, I wrote a song for you
        C              G             D
        And all the things you do, and it was called "Yellow"

        [Chorus]
        Em             D             C              G
        So then I took my turn, oh what a thing to have done
        Em              D             C            G
        And it was all yellow

        [Verse]
        G               D         Em
        Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
        C              G             D
        Turn into something beautiful
        G            D         Em
        And you know, you know I love you so
        C              G             D
        You know, I love you so

        [Chorus]
        Em             D             C              G
        I swam across, I jumped across for you, oh what a thing to do
        Em              D             C            G
        'Cause you were all yellow

        [Bridge]
        G         D          Em
        I drew a line, I drew a line for you
        C         G         D
        Oh what a thing to do
        G         D          Em
        And it was all yellow

        [Instrumental]
        Em   D   C   G

        [Chorus]
        Em             D             C              G
        Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
        Em              D             C            G
        Turn into something beautiful
        Em             D             C              G
        And you know, you know I love you so
        Em              D             C            G
        You know, I love you so

        [Outro]
        Em              D             C            G
        I swam across, I jumped across for you, oh what a thing to do
        Em              D             C            G
        'Cause you were all yellow
        Em              D             C            G
        I drew a line, I drew a line for you, oh what a thing to do
        Em              D             C            G
        And it was all yellow
